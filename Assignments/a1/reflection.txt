## Verification questions

1. What output is printed when your `A1` application is run (with no program arguments)?

   Answer: Order '907' contains 9 items.

## Reflection questions

1. Did any of the "implementation constraints" rule out your first thought for implementing one of
   the functions? (if so, which ones?)  Next, pick one of the functions and briefly describe an
   alternative implementation that _would_ violate its implementation constraint (while still
   fulfilling its specification).

   Answer: When I was first completing the estimatePi function, I overlooked the constraint that
   stated that the 'Math.pow' function could not be called; I originally intended to approximate
   pi using a different formula that we used to do so in CS 1112.

   The function collatzSum could be alternatively implemented recursively. Rather than using a while loop,
   a recursive function could be set up with base cases that determine whether the function is returned (recursively)
   with s/2 or s*3+1. Although this would work, it could not be done because this method would violate the constraint
   that requires a while loop.
