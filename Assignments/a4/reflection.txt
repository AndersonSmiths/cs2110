## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a
   dodecahedron?  (Note: `edgeLength` is a parameter of the formula and should be parsed as a
   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: The trickiest part of the project for me was definitely conceptualizing the spreadsheet word.
   When I first got to Part IV, it took me several hours to start understanding exactly
   what I was doing. However, when I finally actually started making my own spreadsheets, the concept
   came to me a lot quicker.
