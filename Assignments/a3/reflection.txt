## Verification questions

1. Run your `CsvJoin` application with program arguments so that it attempts to join
   `tests/testCsvToList/non-rectangular.csv` (on the left) with `tests/testCsvToList/empty-col.csv`
   (on the right).  What **red text** does your program print to IntelliJ's console?
   (as a reminder, it had better not include a stack trace)

   Answer: Input tables are not rectangular.

## Reflection questions

1. Which `LinkedSeq` operation did you think was the most difficult to implement and debug?  What
   corner case caught you by surprise or was particularly awkward to handle?  Finally, describe a
   testing scenario that you added which covers this corner case.

   Answer: the remove(elem) method for me was really difficult to implement and debug. This is because
   I kept on having issues with one of the corner cases; it took me a long time to figure out how to properly
   remove a node if it was the head. I actually only caught this bug because of a test that I had
   previously implemented. This test case was, well, testing that the LinkedSeq remained accurate
   and ordered properly if the head was removed.

2. How did you plan and budget your time so that you could complete and debug your application by
   the deadline?  If you worked as partners, how did you coordinate to ensure in advance that you
   would have sufficient time to work on the project together?

   Answer: Up until Thursday, I planned and budgeted my time exactly how the A3 instructions reccommend.
   Then, because my girlfriend came in town and I needed to pick her up from Syracuse, I skipped out on
   working on this assignment on thursday. Then, on friday, I completed the main method as well as test cases
   for it.
